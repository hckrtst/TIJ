## 1.4.2.  Procedure and Operation Structure

   A significant departure from the previous versions of the NFS
   protocol is the introduction of the COMPOUND procedure.  For the NFS
   version 4 protocol, there are two RPC procedures, NULL and COMPOUND.
   The COMPOUND procedure is defined in terms of operations and these
   operations correspond more closely to the traditional NFS procedures.
